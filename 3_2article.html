                    Bibimbap is a popular Korean dish that literally means "mixed rice." It's a colorful and healthy meal that's packed with different flavors and textures. The dish consists of a bowl of rice topped with an assortment of vegetables, meat, and sometimes egg, all served with a spicy sauce called gochujang. Hannah Bang, a talented singer and vlogger, has shared her best bibimbap recipe that will make your mouth water.

                        Cook the rice according to package instructions. While the rice is cooking, prepare the vegetables. Hannah recommends using carrots, spinach, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and zucchini. Slice the vegetables into thin strips or bite-sized pieces and blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes until they are tender. Then, shock them in ice water to stop the cooking process and retain their color.

                        Cook the meat. Hannah suggests using beef or chicken, but you can also use tofu or shrimp for a vegetarian option. Marinate the meat in soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and sugar for at least 30 minutes. Then, saut√© the meat in a hot pan until it's cooked through.

                        To assemble the bibimbap, place a serving of rice in the bottom of a bowl. Arrange the vegetables and meat on top of the rice in a circular pattern, and then top it with a fried egg if desired. Serve with a dollop of gochujang sauce on the side and mix everything together before eating.
