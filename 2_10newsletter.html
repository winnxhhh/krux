                    Welcome to this week's newsletter! As we approach Women's History Month, we want to dedicate this week's newsletter to two remarkable women: model Sheila Yoon and actress Sohn Minhee. They recently sat down for an interview with WMN Korea, where they discussed their personal experiences and insights on women in power.                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, let's talk about Sheila Yoon. She is a Korean-American model who has worked with numerous fashion brands and has graced the covers of several magazines. In the interview, Yoon talked about the challenges she faced as a minority in the fashion industry and the importance of representation.

                    Yoon shared that when she first started modeling, she felt like she didn't belong in the industry because of her Asian features. However, she realized that she could use her uniqueness to stand out and create a positive impact. Yoon said, "It's important for women to see someone who looks like them in the media. It's empowering to know that you can achieve anything you want regardless of your background."                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yoon also emphasized the need for diversity in the fashion industry, saying that it's not just about hiring models of different ethnicities, but also about having diverse perspectives in the decision-making process. Yoon believes that when people with different backgrounds come together, they can create something truly unique and beautiful.

                    <br>
                    Next up is Sohn Minhee, an actress known for her roles in popular Korean dramas such as "Where is Bomi" and "Lovely Morning". In the interview, Sohn talked about the challenges she faced as a woman in the entertainment industry and the importance of speaking up for oneself.

                    Sohn shared that when she first started acting, she was often given stereotypical roles that didn't showcase her full potential as an actress. However, she didn't let that discourage her and worked hard to improve her craft. Sohn said, "It's important to believe in yourself and your abilities. You have to know your worth and not settle for anything less."                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sohn also talked about the issue of gender inequality in the entertainment industry and how she's been working to create a more equal playing field. She said that women are often overlooked for certain roles or paid less than their male counterparts, but that things are slowly starting to change. Sohn believes that by speaking up and demanding equal treatment, women can make a difference and create a better future for themselves and others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, Sheila Yoon and Sohn Minhee are two amazing women who have overcome numerous challenges to become successful in their respective fields. They have also used their platforms to advocate for diversity and gender equality, which is something we can all learn from. As we continue to celebrate Women's History Month, let's take inspiration from these women and work towards creating a more inclusive and equal society.
