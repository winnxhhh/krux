                    Welcome to our weekly newsletter! This week, we bring you exciting news from two Korean artists: soloist Park Youngji and rapper HHJ.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Park Youngji, a former member of the K-pop girl group ArkE, has announced her engagement to her non-celebrity fiancé. The news was shared through her agency MNH Media, who released a statement saying, "Park Youngji has recently confirmed her relationship with her non-celebrity boyfriend and they have decided to get married. The wedding date has not been set yet, and we ask for your warm blessings for their future together."

                    Fans were overjoyed to hear the news and congratulated the couple on social media. Park Youngji debuted in the K-pop industry as a member of ArkE in 2018, and later became a solo artist after the group disbanded in 2020. She has since released several successful singles and made a name for herself as a talented singer and performer.

                    Meanwhile, rapper HHJ, also known as Hwang Hyunjun, took some time off to vacation in Italy. He shared pictures of his trip on his social media, including shots of famous landmarks such as the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain. Fans were thrilled to see him enjoying his time off and praised him for his hard work.

                    Italy has always been a popular travel destination for people around the world, with its rich history, culture, and food. The country is home to numerous famous landmarks, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Vatican City, and the canals of Venice. It's no wonder that HHJ chose Italy as his vacation spot– the country offers something for everyone, from stunning architecture to delicious food and wine.                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While Park Youngji and HHJ may have different reasons for making headlines this week, both artists remind us that there is always something to look forward to in life. Whether it's getting engaged to the love of your life or taking a break to explore new places, we should all take the time to enjoy the little things that make us happy.

                    In the midst of a global pandemic, it's more important than ever to focus on the positive things in our lives. While we may not be able to travel or attend concerts like we used to, we can still find joy in the simple things – a good book, a home-cooked meal, or a phone call with a loved one. By focusing on the good, we can get through even the toughest times.
