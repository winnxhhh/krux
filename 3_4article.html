                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To start, gather your ingredients. You'll need 200g of glass noodles, 1 medium-sized onion, 1 red bell pepper, 2 carrots, 150g of spinach, 150g of beef, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. You can find these ingredients at most grocery stores or Asian markets.

                <ol type="1" class="kapsuleList">
                    <li>
                        Begin by boiling the glass noodles for 7-8 minutes until they're fully cooked. Drain and rinse them under cold water, and then toss them with a tablespoon of sesame oil to prevent them from sticking.                    
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    <br>
    
                    <li>
                        Next, prepare the vegetables. Slice the onion and red bell pepper into thin strips and julienne the carrots. Sauté them in a tablespoon of vegetable oil until they're softened, and then add the minced garlic and spinach. Cook until the spinach is wilted, and then remove the vegetables from the heat.                    
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        In the same pan, cook the beef until it's browned and fully cooked. Add the vegetables back to the pan, and then toss in the cooked glass noodles. Drizzle soy sauce and sugar over the mixture, and then toss everything together until it's fully coated.                    
                    </li>
    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Your Japchae is now ready to serve! You can garnish it with toasted sesame seeds or chopped green onions for extra flavor and texture. This dish is versatile and can be served hot or cold, making it a great option for meal prep or leftovers.                    
                    </li>
                </ol>
